            <p>After graduating from high school he attended Santa Monica Jr. College, Orange Coast College and Laguna School of Art. His Majors were Electronics, Architectural Illustration, Management and Fine Art.</p>
            <p>Between 1957-1960. Richard worked at Kett Engineering, Renner Inc., 
              Motorola as a Technical Illustrator, and General Telephone-Draftsman.</p>
            <p><br>
              In Feb, 1960 Richard took on the challenge of working for 
              Douglas Aircraft: doing Silkscreen Fabrication, Circuit Boards, Nameplates 
              and Murals for the DC8 &amp; DC10 aircrafts.</p>

            <p>In Sept, 1964 Richard left McDonnell Douglas and went to Pasadena, 
              CA. at Nelson Nameplate Co. as a foreman over<br>
              8 people (including 
              3 Navajo Indians)*</p>
            <p>In Sept, 1965 Richard returned to McDonnell Douglas hired as an 
              Assistant Foreman over Silkscreen, Encapsulation, Circuit Boards and 
              refurbishing of Umbilical Cords that ran from the Block House to the 
              S-IVB on pad. He was involved in training Tech Personnel to silkscreen 
              on site at Cape Canaveral. At that time he was supervising a total of 35 
              people at McDonnell Douglas, Santa Monica.</p>
            <p>In April,1969; Richard left McDonnell Douglas and drove to Fairbanks, 
              Alaska up the Al Can Highway in his 1965 Ford Econoline Van. The van took 
              a beating. He was in need of money to fix his van so he got a job with 
              the emergency fire crews. When the fire season starts in Fairbanks they 
              look for seasoned fire fighters from the years before. In his case he had
              no fire fighting experience but had experience with organizing people 
              and some experience with the Indian Culture*.</p>

            <p>In Fairbanks, the Athabaskan Indians knew how to fight fires. They 
              hired him to keep them organized and he learned as much as he could 
              as fast as he could. After several forest fires, some made it to the 
              hot shot fire crews. They were picked to go on “Helitac” for the 
              Fairbanks Bureau of Land Management. </p>

            <p>They would send them out 
              in a Helicopter to hold the fire line until the regular fire crews were 
              able to make it to the fire. Note: If you have time to take pictures of the fire you have time to fight it. No photos until after we have done our job. If you didn' agree with that you would be releaved of your command!</p>
            <p>In October of 1969, he returned to Orange County and stayed with his 
              family. His Sister-in-law was a watercolor artist working out of her
              back room. She and her partner did Architectural Illustrations and 
              Topo Tables for a few clients. So in November of 1971, they decided
              to form a new company, the beginning of “Peck’s Builders Art”...</p>
            <p> In February of 1972, he moved “PBA” out of the house and
              into a small office. In 1976, after a few moves they had 
              Silkscreen capability. They were building displays, spray painting,
              vinyl lettering and still doing Illustrations. They had up to 13 people 
              and close to 3,000 sq. Ft.. In 1983 Richard Peck bought out his partner and is
              still in business today doing graphic arts.</p>
